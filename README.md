# LangchainExperiments
Document Generation Experiments.

This project tries to experiment with langchain to see if we can generate some design documents needed for governance based on LLM. The idea is to create a bunch of sample documents to pull from based on various common features we find in applications. Based on the prompts provided by the user we try to generate documentation.
